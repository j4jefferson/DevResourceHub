# List of useful resources

This is where I keep various links to tools, services and websites that I often use (depending on the project). I like to build with Javascript stack and enjoy experimenting with APIs, databases/graphql, cloud platforms and services. So if I find something great I will put it here. Let me know if you found something awesome I should check out.
